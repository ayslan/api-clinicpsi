# ClinicPSI

ClinicPSI.API is the WEB.API of a software application made to help psychologists in scheduling appointments with their patients and controlling the patient records. Please note that the software is still under development and not yet finished. I have already implemented the user registration, user login and customer registration. Some technologies used in API: .NET 5, IdentityServer, EF Core, ReactJS, Redux, sagas, and Typescript.

This is the frontend [ClinicPSI.WEB](https://github.com/ayslan/web-clinicpsi)
